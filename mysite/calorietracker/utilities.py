# TDEE Calculator
def calculate_TDEE(CI, weights, n, units="lbs", smooth=True, window=5):
    """
    Total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) is an estimate of daily caloric expenditure.
    This is a combination of one's basal metabolic rate (BMR) + numerous other factors like non-exercise activity thermogenesis, activity calories etc.
    The mathematical components of TDEE (e.g. NEAT, BMR, activity calories etc.) are considerably variable from person to person
    Thus, the best way to get aan accurate estimate of TDEE is by calculating it based on an invidual's series of weights and caloric intake

    The amount of data required to get an accurate estimate is difficult to say due to daily variations in weight secondary to water loss and GI waste
    It is also difficult to say because a person's activity level in terms of exercise and NEAT may change behaviourly over the course of long periods of time

    Thus TDEE should be constantly reevaluated using the last X days of data to give the most accurate representation.

    Here we will take a 2 inputs as np arrays: [daily calorie intakes] and [weights] over time. The length of each array is the number of days of data.
    Mathematically, calculating TDEE from this is straight forward:
        - Take the weight change from start to begining
        - Convert this weight change to calories (e.g. lbs * 3500)
        - Take the sum of daily calorie intakes
        - Take the difference betweeen the above two (i.e. total caloric intake - weight change in calories) and divide by total days
        - The result is the estimated TDEE over the last days

    The only caveat in this calculation is the day to day variability in weight affecting the total weight change calculation.
    This is counteracted by smoothing the weight over 'window' days.

    Parameters
    ----------
    CI : daily caloric intake
        list
    Weights : daily weights list
        list
    n : last number of days to calculate TDEE over
        int
    units : unit of weights
        string: "lbs" or "kgs"
    smooth : If true, will use moving_average() to smooth the daily weights, reducing day-to-day variation
        bool, default = True
    window : If smooth is true, the window over which averages will be computed
